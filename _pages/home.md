### About the Lab

A state of the art IoT (Internet of Things) lab and alongside a curriculum supported by industry on IoT. The vision for this world class lab was set by EE HOD Prof Rohin Daruwala and his team.
The alumni of the batch of Electrical engineering 89 have decided to fund the setup of this lab along with the VJTI alumni association. TCS experts in the field of IoT will enable the setup and ongoing support to the lab with the leverage of its Co-Innovation Network partners ecosystem.
